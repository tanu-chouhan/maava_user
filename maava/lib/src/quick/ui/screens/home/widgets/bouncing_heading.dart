/// A heading that arrives, performs, and leaves — on a loop.
///
/// Four beats, in order, repeating forever:
///  1. **In** — scales up from nothing to full size, overshooting slightly
///     before it settles, so it lands rather than merely stops growing.
///  2. **Bounce** — at full size, the characters hop upward one after another,
///     left to right, in a wave that crosses the whole heading once.
///  3. **Out** — scales back down to nothing, winding up a touch first.
///  4. **Gap** — nothing on screen, then it all begins again.
///
/// The wave's stagger is per character rather than per heading, so a long
/// backend heading sweeps at the same pace as a short one; only the cycle gets
/// longer. [cycleFor] is the whole loop's length for a given heading.
///
/// This is the only place the motion is defined, so every sale banner and
/// section title animates identically. Give it whatever heading the backend
/// sends; the text needs to know nothing about the animation.
///
/// It takes [text] and [style] rather than a child widget because it has to
/// split the string itself. That split is a PAINTING detail, not a semantic
/// one: the characters are wrapped in [Semantics] carrying the whole string, so
/// a screen reader announces "Grocery Sale" once, steadily, however the visual
/// is scaling at the time.
///
/// Every beat is a paint-time transform, so the heading holds its final
/// footprint from the first frame to the last — including while it is scaled
/// away to nothing. Nothing around it reflows as it comes and goes.
