/// Applies the quick-commerce module's own [ThemeData] to its subtree.
///
/// The MAAVA `MaterialApp` is themed for the food vertical, and quick screens
/// depend on this module's component themes and the [AppSemanticColors]
/// extension — without this scope, `context.semantic` falls back to defaults on
/// a theme that never registered the extension.
///
/// The brand comes from [martBrandProvider] — the colour the admin panel
/// publishes for the Mart module. This is the ONE place Mart's palette is
/// decided: every mart screen reads its colours off this `ThemeData` (via
/// `colorScheme` or `context.semantic`) rather than off a constant, so changing
/// the admin setting repaints all of them.
///
/// Light/dark still follows the app-wide ambient brightness so the two
/// verticals never disagree on dark mode.
///
/// It also sets a DEFAULT status-bar style for the whole module, matched to the
/// theme's surface. Most Mart screens set none of their own, and a screen with
/// no style inherits whatever the last one pushed — so arriving at a white
/// listing from the home screen's deep brand header left white icons on white.
/// A screen that paints something else behind the bar (home, with its gradient)
/// wraps itself in its own [StatusBarStyle], which sits deeper and wins.
