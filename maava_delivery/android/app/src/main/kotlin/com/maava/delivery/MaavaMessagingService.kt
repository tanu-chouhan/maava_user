/**
 * Sees every push before Flutter does, purely so a new order can be drawn
 * without waking a Flutter engine first.
 *
 * `super.onMessageReceived` is always called, so the existing Dart handlers —
 * `onMessage`, `onBackgroundMessage`, the notification the background isolate
 * posts — behave exactly as before. This adds a path; it replaces nothing.
 *
 * Declared in AndroidManifest.xml with the MESSAGING_EVENT filter, which
 * supersedes the plugin's own service registration. Because this class extends
 * that service, superseding it costs nothing.
