/**
 * A support conversation thread.
 *
 * Conversations were previously DERIVED from the messages themselves — grouping
 * food_chat_messages by conversationId gave a peer, a last message and an unread
 * count, and nothing else. That is enough for an order chat, but not for support:
 * a thread the user opened as "I want to cancel my order" and an agent later
 * closed has a subject and a lifecycle that no message carries.
 *
 * This document holds only that extra state. Messages remain the source of truth
 * for lastMessage / lastAt / unread, so a conversation with no document here still
 * lists correctly and nothing had to be backfilled.
